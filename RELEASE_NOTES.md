# 0.0.9 

* Removed cache for **find{Bio/Tech}Act**, in order to lower memory usage.
Instead, we now use core Brightway capabilities for searching activities.
* Added function **sobol_simplify_model** for generating simplified models, 
and **compare_simplified** for comparing their distributions with the initial model.

# 0.0.8

Cleanup dependencies

# 0.0.7

* Added parameters 'var_params' for all stats tools, for providing list of parameters to vary.
  Other parameters will be set at their default value.
* Fixed typo in the function name **incer_stochastic_dahboard** => **incer_stochastic_dashboard**
* Fixed bug of int overload : convert everything to float

# 0.0.6 

* Rename **modelToExpr()** to **simplifiedModel()**
* Improve performance of computation. Added multithread computation for LCA and Sobol.
* Added method **sobol_simplify_model** that computes list of most meaningful parameters, 
based on Sobol analysis, and then generates simplified models based on it.

# 0.0.5

* Add function `modelToExpr(model, impacts)`, returning expression with background activities replaced 
by the value of each impact.


# 0.0.4

* Added button for **exporting** data as csv on any **Dataframe** in stats tools
* **actToExpression** now replaces fixed params by their default values, providing simplified models.
* **newSwitchAct** can take custom amounts (not only '1') by providing tuple (act, amount)

# 0.0.3

First released version
