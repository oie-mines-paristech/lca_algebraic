    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents **lca-algebraic** a small libray above **brightay2**, designed for the definition of **parametric inventories** with fast computation of LCA impacts, suitable for **monte-carlo** analyis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**lca-algebraic** provides a set of  **helper functions** for : \n",
    "* **compact** & **human readable** definition of activites :  \n",
    "    * search background (tech and biosphere) activities \n",
    "    * create new foreground activites with parametrized amounts\n",
    "    * parametrize / update existing background activities (extending the class **Activity**)\n",
    "* Definition of parameters\n",
    "* Computation of LCAs \n",
    "* Computation of statistics (including Sobols indices)\n",
    "* Compute simplified parametric model by fixing minor input parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Principles \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of this libray is to move from **procedural definition** of models (slow and prone to errors) to a **declarative / purely functionnal** definition of parametric models (models as **pure functions**). \n",
    "\n",
    "This enables **fast computation of LCA impacts**, useful for Monte Carlo methods and statistical analysis. \n",
    "We leverage the **power of symbolic calculus** provided by the library [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our model in a **separate database**, as a nested combination of : \n",
    "* other foreground activities\n",
    "* background activities :\n",
    "    * Technical, refering **ecoinvent DB**\n",
    "    * Biosphere, refering **brightway2** biosphere activities\n",
    "    \n",
    "The **amounts** in exchanges are expressed either as **static amounts**, or **symbolic expressions** of pre-defined **parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each activity of our **root model** is defined as a **parametrized combination** of the **foreground activities**, which can themselves be expressed by the **background activities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing LCA for foreground models, the library develops the model as a combination of **only background activities**. It computes **once for all** the impact of **all required background activities** and compiles a **fast numpy** (vectorial) function for each impact, replacing each background activity by the **static value of the corresponding impact**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing **large vectors** of **parameter values** to those numpy functions, we can compute LCA for **thousands of values** at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://oie-mines-paristech.github.io/lca_algebraic/doc/lca-algebraic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compatiblity with brightway2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the activities we define with **lca-algebraic** are standard **brightway2** activities. \n",
    "The amounts of exchanges are stored as **float values** or **serialized as string** in the property **formula**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters are also stored in the **brightay2** projets, making it fully compatible with **brightway**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a model defined with **lca-algebraic** is stored as a regular **bw2** projet. We can use **bw2** native support for [parametrized dataset](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/intro.html#parameterized-datasets) for computing LCAs, even if much more slower than the method explain here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Doc\n",
    "\n",
    "The followng notebook explores the main functions.\n",
    "Full documentation of the functions is [available here](https://oie-mines-paristech.github.io/lca_algebraic/doc/)\n",
